#  Online News Popularity Prediction  

## Introduction  
In the digital era, news articles compete for attention in an overcrowded online space. Understanding what drives the popularity of news articles is crucial for media outlets looking to maximize engagement.  

This project applies **data science**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **machine learning** to predict and analyze the factors influencing news article popularity.  

---

##  Project Objectives  
 Identify key features that correlate with high levels of engagement and social media shares.  
Apply **feature engineering techniques** to enhance predictive modeling.  
 Develop robust **machine learning models** to forecast article popularity.

##  Dataset  
This project utilizes the [**Online News Popularity Dataset**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/332/online+news+popularity) from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The dataset contains approximately **39,000 news articles** with various attributes.  

###  Key Features  
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `url` | URL of the article |
| `timedelta` | Days between publication and data collection |
| `n_tokens_title` | Number of words in the title |
| `n_tokens_content` | Number of words in the content |
| `n_shares` | Number of social media shares (Target variable) |
| `data_channel_is_*` | Indicates the article’s category (e.g., Lifestyle, Business, etc.) |

###  Target Variable  
- `n_shares`** → The number of times a news article has been shared on social media.  
- Our goal is to **predict article shares** based on different features in the dataset.

##  Methodology  

###  1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Normalization and feature scaling  
- Encoding categorical variables  

###  2. Feature Engineering  
- Text-based feature extraction** (headline length, keyword density)  
- Sentiment analysis** to assess emotional tone  
- Topic modeling** to classify article content  

###  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Data visualizations  
- Correlation analysis  

###  4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques  
- Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, lemmatization  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
- Text Clustering**  

### 5. Model Development  
We apply both **classification** and **regression** techniques:  

####  Regression Models  
Linear Regression  
Lasso Regression  
Ridge Regression  

#### Classification Models  
Naïve Bayes  
 K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)  
 XGBoost
